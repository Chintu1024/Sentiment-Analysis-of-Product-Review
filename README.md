**Product Review Sentiment Analysis**
/n
"The goal of this project is to analyse customer reviews to determine their sentiment (positive, negative or neutral) based on the text content of the reviews and associated metadata. This will help in understanding customer feedback, identifying product strengths and weaknesses and improving the overall customer experience by offering actionable insights.\n",
      Problem Statement:
        "E-commerce platforms like Amazon, Jumia, Konga, Ebay, Ali Express and other online retailers in Nigeria and beyond collect millions of product reviews daily. These reviews are rich sources of customer feedback but are often unstructured, making manual analysis time-consuming and inefficient. Companies often need to quickly interpret the sentiments expressed in these reviews to understand how customers feel about their products, identify key pain points and adjust their business strategies accordingly. However, sorting through vast amounts of text data to understand customer sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) poses a significant challenge. This project aims to automate the process of sentiment analysis using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By automating sentiment detection, businesses can gain real-time insights from reviews, leading to better decision-making, improved product offerings and enhanced customer satisfaction.\n",
        Key Steps in the Project:
        "1. **Data Collection**: Utilise the provided dataset containing customer reviews and associated metadata, such as star ratings and product categories.\n",
        "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, clean text (e.g remove noise and irrelevant symbols) and standardise review content.\n",
        "3. **Sentiment Labelling**: Use star ratings to label reviews as negative (1-2 stars), neutral (3 stars) or positive (4-5 stars).\n",
        "4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  Visualise the distribution of sentiments across different product categories and review ratings.\n",
        "5. **Feature Extraction and Text Processing**: Convert review text into numerical features using tokenization, stopword removal and TF-IDF vectorization.\n",
        "6. **Model Selection and Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (such as logistic regression, random forest or neural networks) to predict review sentiment based on extracted features.\n",
        "7. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score to ensure reliable sentiment predictions.\n",
        "8. **Performance Metrics**: Analyse metrics like confusion matrix and detailed performance scores to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model.\n",
        "9. **Building a Sentiment Analysis Dashboard with Streamlit and Real-Time Sentiment Prediction**: Create an interactive dashboard to visualise sentiment distribution and allow users to input reviews for real-time sentiment predictions.\n",
        "10. **Business Insights and Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights and recommendations to businesses to improve product offerings based on patterns identified in customer feedback."
